Data folder organization:

1)All data are stored in “DSIM_data” folder.

2) “actual_data” contains the actual data for 10 patients of DSIM dataset. 

3) “missing_data” contains all simulated missing values of actual data. Missing values are simulated for 5%-50% missing ratios with a step size of 5%.

4) “full_row_missing” contains simulated missing data where all variables in a row is missing. 

5) “imputed_data” contains all the imputed files generated by our method. It has a subfolder called “full_row_missing_impute” which contains imputed files for full_row_missing files.




How to run the program:

1) Open Matlab command window.

2) set current working directory in MATLAB to this folder

3) write the command run_Imput_MI_FKnn(input_file,output_file,num_var) and press enter. Here ‘input_file’ is the csv file name with path containing missing values, ‘output_file’ is also a csv file that will store the output data matrix and ‘num_var’ is number of variable in the input file. One example for OS X is run_Impute_MI_FKnn('./DSIM_data/missing_data/pid_1_noise10_mAmount5.csv','./DSIM_data/imputed_data/pid_1_Imp_mAmount5.csv',16)

4)Input file format is ‘patient_id,time, value1,value2,…..’
If the data format is different, one needs to load the data into a matrix, X, and call the function ‘Impute_MI_FKnn(X)’ in the command window.

We refer to the individual .m file for details on the function and their parameters.
